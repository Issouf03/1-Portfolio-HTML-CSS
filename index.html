                <p> Originally from Burkina Faso, a small country located in west Africa, I moved to the US in 2012
                    after
                    completing my high school degree. Coming to America, I did not know any English but I was, as always
                    eager to learn and in three months I was able to stand in front of a class to give a speech about my
                    country. </p>
                <br>
                <p> I spent my first three months in the US in a college town called Eugene, in Oregon. Then I moved to
                    New
                    York where I spent the next seven years going to school. I first studied English for another three
                    months, then I started my academic program in Electronics engineering Technology at the city
                    university
                    of New York in the Bronx. I graduated in May 2015 and pursued a Bachelor in electrical Engineering
                    at
                    the State University of New York at New Paltz. I graduated from New Paltz in May 2019. One month
                    later,
                    I decided to leave New York and adventure in the west coast precisely in Seattle, WA. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Why Seattle? A simple google search showed that Seattle is one of the fast growing city in the US
                    with
                    lots of tech Jobs. Plus I have visited the city before moving to New York and also in spring 2016
                    and I
                    fell in love with the nice views, the nice weather and the modern houses. So, Without hesitation, I
                    packed my staff and took off. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Once in Seattle, I found out that most of the high paying jobs are in the programming world, plus I
                    have
                    always wanted to learn how to code. So I decided to go for a coding Bootcamp and the only one
                    flexible
                    with my schedule was the UW-Bootcamp. </p>
                <br>
                <p> I hope to get out of this program competitively ready to embrace the job market.</p>
